Dragons in Wildlander are not the easy to kill creatures the were in vanilla. They are Heavily armored, Magic breathing flying tanks with teeth which can cut through allow low to mid quality armors with one bite and you think you can send a follower to the teeth end while you rain damage down on the tail - think again, as the tail is capable of knockdowns.

The trick to fighting any dragon, isn't stats, its tactics. Being 100 skill in everything isnt enough to guarantee your survival if you miss a black. At lower levels, Even if a dragon's attacks can 1-shot you, it's possible to take them down by appropriately timed dodges, hiding and enough Equipment. 

1. Choose your battlefield: In most cases, you have some control over where most the fight occurs. Even if a dragon swoops in on you, there is a small window to re-position yourself. Try to pick an area that has several pieces of full cover (tall enough to fully block their breath weapon from both the ground and a low hover). Ideally, this cover can be circled (in case the dragon lands/hovers behind you), and is in such a spot that the dragon cannot land on top of you. Practice this at word walls, where the wall itself can be used as cover.
1. Cover is life: A dragon cannot kill what it cannot hit. Make sure that there is always at least a piece of full cover adjacent to you so you can duck behind it in that split second before the dragon breathes. The Become Ethereal shout is especially useful for those "Oh shit" moments when you get caught out of cover.
1. Patience is a virtue: Dragons aren't short fights, so resist the urge to leave your cover spot deal damage, all it takes is a single bad move, the dragon to turn around and bite your face off to end a long fight (and not in your favor). A dragon has the advantage in terms of stats, the only advantage you have is your brain.
1. Know when to run: Sometimes, it just isn't your time to shine. Don't be afraid of a tactical withdraw, either to fully flee, or to regroup. Just make sure that you do it carefully (sticking to cover). Also, if 2 dragons engage you at once...NOPE the hell outta there. They WILL kill you.
1. Choose the right time of day - you dont want to be attacking a dragon as the sun is setting.

Here are some things that make fighting dragons easier. You don't need all, but depending on your build, some become more necessary than others:

* Solid Properly Enchanted Armor - for HA Characters the more armor the better
* High Magic Resistance - Shouts cant one-shot you if you resist 99% of the damage
* Tanky follower(s) - to keep the "teeth end" occupied
* Excellent ranged damage (bow, crossbow or Destruction magic) - Also properly enchanted.
* Lots of Very good poison for your bow
* Marked for Death shout - to reduce their armor
* Become Ethereal shout - for those 'Oh Shit' another dragon just showed up moments
* Slow time shout - really useful if you cast marked for death then slow time as melee - lets you get a lot of hits in and take off a good chunk of health.
* Shouts are best mitigated by taking the Speech perk Indomitable Force. This perk halves damage and duration, thus reducing shouts to a quarter of their original damage.
* Buy Great resist potions Fire, Ice and poison; one mistake many people do when playing with Requiem is treating the shop vendors like in vanilla, that is, as garbage bins for your shit only. Do not. Check their inventory because they sell items that will save your life. Great resist potions, occasionally Superlative potions, elemental/magic resist gear

Ranged damage is far safer to melee. Even if the dragon lands, resist the temptation to run in to score a few whacks unless you are properly prepared....it often ends with you rag-dolling across the ground. 
A bow might take longer, but it will keep you 100% more alive.

That being said - Dragons can be fought in melee range with the right preperation. Dragons twist their head to your left before every bite, so that's your red flag to either run away or block; (obviously keep your stamina and health in mind). Blocking works fine too for dragons. With just Improved Blocking, Strong Grip and Experienced Blocking you can block the damage from a bite if you fail to run away fast enough. 

Dragons are NOT stealth Immune, but they have very good eyesight when flying. Its nearly impossible to sneak attack a flying dragon at low to mid levels of sneak.
